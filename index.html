    <h2>Fast</h2>
    <p> Standing on the shoulder of giants. Branching off from clj-spark and flambo, we introduced several changes to really make things fast.
      Speed of execution basically was the driver to have our own library.</p>

    <h2>Clojuric</h2>
    <p> Sparkling provides functions to keep your fingers clean, hiding all the Scala/Java artifacts in nice, clojuric abstractions without bloating the overall system.</p>

  <div class='span4'>
    <h2>Production ready</h2>
    <p>Sparkling is used in our productive environment and battle tested. Don't rely on just toy projects.</p>
