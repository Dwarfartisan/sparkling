If you find a bug, poor default, missing feature or find any part of the API inconvenient, please [file an issue](https://github.com/gorillalabs/sparkling/issues) on Github.
If possible, try to explain what behavior you expected and why. Bonus points for contributing failing test cases.


## Contributing

Sparkling uses [Leiningen 2](http://leiningen.org). Make sure you
have it installed and then run tests against supported Clojure
versions using

    lein do clean, test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done
with your changes and all tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.
